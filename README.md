# V2.6053 Klipper Config
This is the config of my Voron V2.4 300 built from 3030 extrusions: V2.6053
Project found here: https://www.printables.com/model/529700-vevo-hypercube-evolution-frame-conversion-to-voron

Be aware I see my config as WIP and it can and will change from time to time. I normally do only check-in stuff that is tested and run with the base klipper branch. I am not a developer and use this repo as sort of a backup to house my configuration.
